My name is Shawn Leavor and I'm a Tampa native. I started this blog as a way to answer and archive random questions that I wanted the answer to. I'm hoping you find the questions as interesting as I do and look into the questions.

I hope that this can become a portfolio for different topics. I'm mostly inspired by the Freakonomics podcast series and the topics that they explore. It also got me interested in pursuing an economics PhD.

Outside of this, I'm also a fan of travel, food, and drink. I enjoy traveling and experiencing new things, so occasionally that could show up here as well. I'm open to any suggestions, so feel free to shoot them over to sleavor@gmail.com.

Hope you enjoy!

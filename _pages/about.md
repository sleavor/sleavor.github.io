Hi, I'm Shawn and I love doing data analysis projects and sharing them here. I started this blog to keep track of random questions that I wanted to try to answer using data and showcase my progress as I learn more programming skills. I've enjoyed doing most of these projects and want to share them in hopes that someone may be able to learn or even improve on something that they find particularly interesting.

As for myself, I'm a Tampa native and still currently reside here. I got my bachelor's from the University of South Florida (in Tampa) in chemical engineering and German studies. Then I decided to use neither and started as an operations and product manager at a small startup (Defynance) that wanted to help solve the student debt issue. While working there, I got really interested in data anlalytics and started this blog to teach myself Python.

I also go really interested in economics and got inspired by the Freakonomics podcast series, where they answer interesting questions using economics tools. I built on this knowledge and eventually enrolled in a master's of economics program at the University of Texas at Austin. I spent a year there learning more about what I love and getting more involved in data analytics and data science projects. Now I'm trying to improve those skills further and I'm currently at analytics consultant at Deloitte.

Outside of all of that, I'm a huge fan of travelling and exploring different cultures through their food and drink. If I'm not doing that, you can also find me trying to become a better chess player or playing other sports like basketball and soccer.

Thanks for stopping by and hope you enjoy!

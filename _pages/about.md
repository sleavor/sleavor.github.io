My name is Shawn Leavor and I'm a Tampa native. I started this blog as a way to answer and archive random questions that I wanted the answer to. I'm hoping you find the questions as interesting as I do and look into the questions. I'm interested in improving both my programming and data analysis skills. I hope to learn a lot along the way and hopefully help others learn as well.

I plan to touch on a lot of different topics just based on what interests me. I'm mostly inspired by the Freakonomics podcast series and the topics that they explore. It also got me interested in pursuing economics. I recently graduated from the University of Texas at Austin with my Master's in Economics.

Outside of this, I'm also a fan of travel, food, and drink. When I have some free time, I like to go hiking and just visiting new places. 

Thanks for stopping by and hope you enjoy!

This page tells you a little bit about me.

My name is Shawn Leavor and I consider Tampa, FL my home. I've been in Tampa pretty much my whole life and even attended USF here. I got my Bachelor's degrees in Chemical Engineering and German Studies in May of 2018. Since then, I've moved away from that and became more interested in coding and economics. Since I've graduated I've been working at Defynance, a small fintech startup, as their operations manager.

I'm also a huge fan of travel, sports, food, and drink. I'm always looking for my next experience.

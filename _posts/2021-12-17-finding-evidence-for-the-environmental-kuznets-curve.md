*Finding Evidence for the Environmental Kuznets Curve*

Introduction:

The Kuznets curve was first published in 1955i to describe the relationship between income inequality and per capita income. The shape was an inverted U which proposed that as an economy grows, inequality will increase until it hits a turning point and inequality starts to decrease again. In 1995, Grossman and Kruegerii first applied the concept of the Kuznets curve to the environment. They found that as an economy grows and until it reaches a per capita income of $8,000, the country will increase it's pollution. However, after the turning point, that economy will start to lower it's pollution levels. 

Many papers over the years have disputed the existence of the environmental Kuznets curve, including evidence of an N-shaped and inverted N-shape relationship between GDP per capita and carbon dioxide emissions per capitaiii.

First, we examine the relationship between GDP per capita and carbon emissions per capita to determine if there is evidence of an environmental Kuznets curve. For this, we chose 23 different countries in various stages of development and used data that pairs countries by demographics, such as income levels. Here we will examine if countries that are in developing stages are polluting more, while those that are developed are lowering their emissions. 

Next, we examine how a carbon cap will affect the economy of a developing nation. The carbon cap will be based on the 1990 level of emissions. Countries will have to end up at a percentage under the 1990 level. By proposing different carbon caps, we can examine the effect of these caps on an economy. We will examine how such an emissions cap will also cap the amount that a nation's GDP can grow based on the environmental Kuznets Curve theory. 

Finally, there is a discussion on how developed nations can bridge the gap of developing nations. Would it be beneficial for developed nations to pay for the alternative energy sources of countries that are affected by the carbon cap? How much should a nation be willing to fund and does that amount depend on the amount of trade a developed country does with a developing nation?


Here, have some $$\pi$$.
